>As a student developer, I'm passionate about solving problems creatively and gaining new skills on my developer journey. I specialize in web development and love applying responsive design principles to my websites, ensuring they look amazing on any device. My skills include C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS, ReactJs, NodeJs and Graphic Designing, among others. I'm also proficient in user experience (UX) design and data structures and algorithms.

I'm currently seeking an internship with a product-based company to gain real-life experience and essential technical skills for personal growth. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing my guitar, listening to music, gaming, or cooking.

If you're interested in discussing programming, coding, or anything else, feel free to drop me a message. I'd love to help you.
